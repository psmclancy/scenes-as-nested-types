# Scenes as Nested Types
Godot version 4.5

### What to check out:
* Start by running with f5, you should see a janky ImGui vehicle select menu and be able to go to next and previous vehicles
* Look at `source/menus/menu_vehicle_select.gd` for select menu structure
* Look at `library_vehicles.tscn` in both editor AND code to see how accessible it is in either
  * See `library_vehicles.gd` and `prime_vehicle.gd` for critical scripts related to `library_vehicles.tscn`
